# Coal the Burn Rock

I'm *Coal*, and aspiring a developer. At the time of writing, I'm mostly interested in java. I'm currently working on some Minecraft mods at the moment. The most notable of those mods being [Pleasant Pigeons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pleasant-pigeons).


## yeah, that's it...

I don't have anything special planned for this website.

### StackEdit

[StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) is an online Markdown editor. Most of this site was written in Markdown (Which you can find [here](https://github.com/ThePoultryMan/thepoultryman.github.io)) and the rest was written with the help of BootStrap.

### \<zero-md\>

[\<zero-md>](https://zerodevx.github.io/zero-md/) is a markdown displayer that turns the Markdown that I write into HTML. This makes the website as a whole a lot easier to create.
